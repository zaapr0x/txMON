## Configuration

The script uses contract ABIs stored in the `src/abi/` directory. Each contract should have its own JSON file with the following structure:

## Technical Details

- The script uses Web3.js to interact with the Monad blockchain
- Default transaction values:
  - Swap/Stake amount: 0.01 MON
  - Gas price: Automatically determined
  - Gas limit: Automatically estimated + 10% buffer

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Transaction Failed**

   - Ensure you have enough MON for gas fees
   - Check your network connection
   - Verify contract addresses are correct

2. **Contract Not Found**

   - Ensure all contract ABIs are properly formatted in `src/abi/`

3. **Private Key Error**
   - Check that your `.env` file exists and contains the correct private key
